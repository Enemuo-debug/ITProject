    <h2>Where Networking Knowledge Becomes Clear</h2>
    <p>
      Zurus06.NAT is a collaborative networking blog built for learners.
      Draw diagrams, explain ideas visually, and learn with others who care about clarity, not noise.

    <h3>What Zurus06.NAT Is</h3>
    <p>
      This is not a simulator like Cisco Packet Tracer.
      Zurus06.NAT is a **thinking space**.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authors explain networking concepts using diagrams, structured explanations,
      and shared understanding. Readers don’t just consume content — they interact with it.
    </p>

    <h3>How Learning Happens Here</h3>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h4>✍️ Write With Diagrams</h4>
        <p>
          Posts can include drawn network diagrams to explain routing,
          topologies, and protocols visually — the way networks are actually understood.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>👏 Clap to Validate</h4>
        <p>
          Claps are signals of usefulness.
          When readers clap a post, they affirm that it helped them understand something clearly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>💬 Quote to Expand</h4>
        <p>
          Quoting a post allows others to build upon it,
          challenge it, or explain it differently — creating layered understanding.
        </p>

    <h3>How Content Trust Is Built</h3>
    <p>
      Knowledge gains trust through interaction.
      On Zurus06.NAT, posts earn a <strong>validity score</strong> based on how the community responds.
    </p>

    <div class="trust-box">
      <div class="trust-text">
        <p>
          As a post receives claps and meaningful quotes, its validity increases.
          This score is visualized with a small badge next to the post title —
          a quiet indicator that others have found the content reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not about popularity.
          It is about collective confirmation that the explanation makes sense.
